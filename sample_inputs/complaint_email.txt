Dear Support Team,

I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received yesterday. I purchased a product from your store two weeks ago, and it arrived damaged. When I contacted customer service, the representative was unhelpful and dismissive of my concerns.

I would like to request a full refund or a replacement for the damaged item. I have attached the receipt and photos of the damaged product for your reference.

I hope to hear back from you soon with a resolution.

Best regards,
John Doe
